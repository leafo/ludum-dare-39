## How to play

Gamepad recommended, but keyboard works too. Explore the level by using your
flare gun to navigate. Destroy the dark holes to restore light to the floor.
Dark holes will drain light, use that to identify them. If you accidentally hit
one you'll take damage. Once you've removed all the dark holes you energy bar
will be completely full. You can navigate to where you spawned to go to the
next level. On further levels you'll encounter enemies that will shoot you,
they don't need to be eliminated to beat the level.

*Controls:*

* Arrows/Joystick - Move ship and aim
* Z (Button 1) - Fire your flare
* X (Button 2) - Enter next stage when on exit pad and level is complete
